# Reinforcement_Learning_Othello

Please go the othello-gui folder and run the file othello_gui.py using python in the command line. You can execute the following:
```
python othello-gui/othello_gui.py
```
This is a GUI for playing Othello. For now, you can only play against a random-policy agent. But do try it out, it is not that easy!

The rest of the code is mainly environment.py (the environment class) and deep_Qlearning.ipynb, the notebook containing the learning algorithms.
